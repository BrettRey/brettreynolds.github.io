<p>When I first began to read Japanese kana, I could keep only one or
two characters in mind at a time, as if my entire field of view were no
wider than the two that spell the word <em>kana</em>: one sign, then the
next; a syllable, then a word; a word, then a line. It was an oddly
self-referential limitation: I could read <em>kana</em> in the same
narrow way I could think about it. As my time in Japan lengthened, so
too did the stretches of script I could perceive, and eventually words
would pop out of the orthographical noise and embed themselves
ballistically into my consciousness without my having meant to read them
at all.</p>

<p>This kind of <span class="smallcaps">chunking</span> – grouping and
recalling things together to free up memory and attention – is often
thought to be a key factor in language learning, and so, as a language
teacher, I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about it. Years ago, I
reached an epiphany: <span class="smallcaps">chunking</span> is a
metaphor. Or, if you like it cleaner: <span
class="smallcaps">chunking</span> is metaphor, and metaphor is <span
class="smallcaps">chunking</span>.</p>

<p>Perhaps this won't strike you as epiphanic, but to me it was
momentous, the way Robert Pirsig's home-run realization that "good is a
noun" in <em>Lila</em> had to have been to him. Psychologists and
applied linguists talk about <span class="smallcaps">chunking</span> all
the time as if we knew what it was, as if we could point to it, as if we
could watch it happen – when really we can't. We've simply mollycoddled
ourselves into believing that we do, charmed by the allure of a
comfortable metaphor, the sort you can fall asleep inside.</p>

<p>Memory is fallible. It drops, it edits, it invents. Obvious, perhaps,
but it bears repeating. Grouping things into chunks can reduce the
memory load, but sometimes at the cost of accuracy. We're not computers,
and our memory is at liberty to make changes and inspired
connections.</p>

<p>In 1956, George Miller described the limits of immediate memory and
introduced the notion of <span class="smallcaps">chunks</span> in his
paper <em>The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two</em> <span
class="citation">(Miller 1956)</span>. His
observation was that most of us can hold about seven pieces of
information in short-term memory until it's forgotten or replaced by
something else. Try reading the following list, covering it up, and then
reciting it – recalling it: <em>blue</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>Marx</em>,
<em>sarcophagus</em>, <em>the holy ghost</em>, <em>October</em>,
<em>linguistics</em>.</p>

<p>That's nine words, but most of us have created a single unit out of
<em>the holy ghost</em>; we've chunked it, and by doing so we've
increased the total amount of information we can fit into short-term
memory. Each <span class="smallcaps">chunk</span> counts as one piece of
information, chunk size being more or less irrelevant. Try to recall
this later, and <em>the holy ghost</em> may become <em>the Holy
Ghost</em>; the <em>Holy Ghost</em> may become <em>God</em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps we imagine mental brackets, a compacted parcel, an index
entry, a virtual mouse click – each pointing to a specific page in
memory. The fantasy here isn't the mouse click but rather the idea
that there's a "there" there to click on at all.</p>

<p>This kind of imagery is wonderful for explaining that. It explains,
and it explains well. It may also explain us out of the desire to
discover how. While we convey our findings vividly and memorably, there
is a danger that we buy into our own simulacrum. It has been said that
"the price of metaphor is eternal vigilance".</p>

<p>For me, the aphorism itself functions as a <span
class="smallcaps">chunk</span>. Seven words, one rhythm: it stuck. Seven
words, one unit: it stays. So now, if you put it in a list of seven
items for me to hold in short-term memory, it could be a single piece of
information.</p>

<p>I first heard it in the CBC radio series <em>Ideas</em>, in an
episode about Richard Lewontin, in whose mind the <span
class="smallcaps">chunk</span> had stuck as well – or at least so he
thought.</p>

<p>In later scientific literature the line is sometimes attributed to
Arturo Rosenblueth and Norbert Wiener <span class="citation">(Mindell 2013)</span>. Rosenblueth and Wiener
did publish an influential essay on purposeful behavior in
<em>Philosophy of Science</em> in 1950 <span class="citation">(Rosenblueth and Wiener 1950)</span>. The
phrase itself has a much older lineage. Misattribution invites
correction; correction invites searching; searching invites another
misattribution.</p>

<p>In 1790, John Philpot Curran, speaking on the election of the Lord
Mayor of Dublin, declared, "the condition upon which God hath given
liberty to man is eternal vigilance" <span class="citation">(Berkes 2010b)</span>.</p>

<p>In 1809, a biography of Major General James Jackson by Thomas Usher
Pulaski Charlton used the pithier form: "the price of liberty is eternal
vigilance" <span class="citation">(Charlton 1809)</span>.</p>

<p>The wording proved elastic, flipping its order and growing small
additions. The line can be <span class="citation">(Berkes 2010b, 2010a)</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li>"the price of liberty is eternal vigilance" <span class="citation">(Charlton 1809)</span>.</li>
<li>"eternal vigilance is the price we pay for liberty" <span class="citation">(Berkes 2010b)</span>.</li>
<li>"eternal vigilance is the price of liberty" <span class="citation">(Berkes 2010b)</span>.</li>
<li>"the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, but the price of the
Star is only one cent" <span class="citation">(Berkes 2010a)</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the nineteenth century the line was well-known and increasingly
detached from its source, and over time it was frequently misattributed
to Thomas Jefferson <span class="citation">(Berkes 2010b)</span>. Jefferson's afterlife
has been unusually busy in other people's quotation practices.</p>

<p>The metaphor version, at least in my own search, doesn't surface
until much later. Not, that is, until the 1940s. When I searched the
Google Books search engine for this particular value of x for that
particular decade, it proffered up Erwin Schrödinger's book <em>What is
Life?</em> as having an exact match. When I clicked the "snippet view"
link, no view, snippet or otherwise, was forthcoming. Click back to the
general results page and there it's again; reach for the prize and it
vanishes – there it's again – existing only in a kind of quotation
superposition that can't be observed directly without it collapsing.
Even Google's memory fails.</p>

<p>Finally, 1953 turns up a more robust observation, not exactly the
same, not nearly as pithy, but surely, I thought, the admonishment that
Lewontin had been trying to recall. In <em>Scientific Explanation</em>,
Richard Braithwaite wrote, "the price of the employment of models is
eternal vigilance" <span class="citation">(Ruse 1973)</span>. A metaphor is a kind of model: Is this the original <span
class="smallcaps">chunk</span>, Lewontin's inspiration? A model
simplifies to make inquiry possible; a metaphor simplifies to make
comprehension possible. Both repay us in insight; both charge us in
vigilance.</p>

<p>I wrote to him, to ask. He was both gracious and grateful, saying
that he had recently become aware of the misattribution and had been
searching for the source. Unfortunately, he has no memory of ever
reading Braithwaite. The story, at least, is consistent with its own
thesis.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was inevitable. If memory is a kind of model-making, then
model-making is a kind of memory. To remember more, we compress; to
remember truer, we restrain. And to remember at all: vigilance. In the
end the aperture narrows again, and what we can keep in view depends on
how carefully we keep it.</p>
