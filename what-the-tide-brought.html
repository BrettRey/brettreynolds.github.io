<h2>Part One: The Known Sea</h2>

<p>Mara's grandmother had drawn every creature that lived in the waters off Cairnhaven.</p>

<p>The book was called the Bestiary, and it looked the part: a leather folio the size of a family Bible, with a brass clasp and Ada's name tooled into the spine. Inside were hand-painted cards on heavy rag paper, one for each creature, held in place by linen tabs. The leather smelled of linseed oil, and the cards, when you turned them, released a faint scent of walnut ink. Grandmother Ada had used watercolours for the bodies and walnut ink for the labels, and her handwriting was so precise it looked printed until you noticed the way her lowercase <em>g</em>s always swooped a little too far left.</p>

<p>There were 437 cards. Mara had counted them twice. She told herself the second count was for accuracy, not reassurance. Each one showed the creature from above and from the side, with arrows pointing to the features that mattered. Not just what it looked like but what it <em>did</em>: which ones were safe to touch, which ones meant the mackerel were running, which ones only appeared before a storm. The haddock card said <em>good eating, best September</em> in Ada's careful hand. Ada's hand was capable of tenderness, but rarely toward a fish. The lion's mane jellyfish card said <em>beautiful, agonising, do not approach</em> and had a red border.</p>

<p>The Bestiary wasn't a curiosity or a pastime. It was the most important book in Cairnhaven. When Robbie Firth hauled up something unfamiliar in his nets, he didn't send word to Edinburgh. He walked to Ada's house with the thing in a bucket, and Ada opened the Bestiary on her kitchen table, and between the two of them they figured out what it was and what to do about it. The answer was always in there somewhere. Four hundred and thirty-seven cards covered everything that swam, crawled, drifted, or clung to the rocks within twenty miles of the harbour. Not all were animals; there were cards for weeds, spawn, and the signs that preceded them.</p>

<p>Ada had died in March. Mara's mother had died before Mara could remember, so Ada's going left just the two of them &ndash; Mara and her father &ndash; and the book sat on a shelf in Mara's bedroom because nobody knew what to do with it without Ada. Her father said it belonged in the village hall, but he hadn't got around to taking it there, and Mara hadn't reminded him. He said it the way people say <em>tomorrow</em>, meaning <em>later</em>, meaning <em>please don't make me do this yet</em>.</p>

<p>She was thinking about the Bestiary as she walked along the shore that afternoon, her shawl pulled tight against a wind that tasted of salt, but not because of any particular card. She was thinking about the gaps. Ada had left blank cards interleaved throughout the folio &ndash; room for creatures that hadn't been painted yet &ndash; and they bothered Mara the way a missing tooth bothers a tongue. She'd have liked it better finished: every slot filled, every creature accounted for, the coast complete between two covers. <em>A bestiary is never finished</em>, Ada had told her once. <em>If it's finished, it's wrong. It means you've stopped paying attention.</em> Mara could recite it. But privately, a finished bestiary sounded good.</p>

<p>The tide was wrong.</p>

<p>Not dramatically wrong &ndash; not the kind of wrong that sends men running for their boats. Just a few yards out from where it should have been, according to the almanac her father kept by the door. And the water looked different where it met the rocks. Greener. The normal water off Cairnhaven was grey-blue, the colour of old slate, and it had been that colour every day of Mara's eleven years. Now there was a greenish cast to it, as if someone had stirred a drop of something through the shallows.</p>

<p>The fishers had noticed too. At dinner &ndash; fish broth, thin, with bannock &ndash; Mara's father talked about how the catch was off. Not bad, exactly. Just different. Fewer of the things they expected, and more of things they threw back. What they kept, they salted &ndash; you always salted what you could, against the winter. The prawns were smaller. The lobster pots came up with creatures inside them that weren't lobsters and weren't crabs and weren't anything the men could confidently name, so they tipped them over the side and didn't mention it to anyone except each other.</p>

<p>Mara's father mentioned it because Mara asked, and because he still half-forgot she was eleven and not a fishing partner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It'll settle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Water does this. Your grandmother would have said the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Part of Mara wanted him to be right. If the water settled, the Bestiary would still be complete. All 437 cards, everything accounted for.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next day was Saturday, and Mara took the path along the cliff to the tidal pools at Scar Point.</p>

<p>The pools were her place. They'd been her and Ada's place, before. Ada used to sit on the flat rock above the biggest pool and sketch while Mara waded. Every card in the Bestiary had been drawn from life, because Ada said memory was a liar when it came to animals. <em>Your brain wants to turn everything into something you already know</em>, she'd said. <em>If you draw from memory, you'll draw a fish. If you draw from life, you'll draw</em> this <em>fish.</em></p>

<p>She passed the small pool below the headland and stopped. It was dead. Not changed &ndash; dead. The water was grey and still and it smelled of rot, a thick sulphurous smell that made her step back. No anemones, no periwinkles, no weed. Nothing. Just grey water and bare rock and the smell. She'd last checked this pool a fortnight ago, and it had been ordinary &ndash; cold, clear, full of the usual things. Now it looked like something had been poured into it that killed everything and then left.</p>

<p>She hurried on. The main pool was still alive &ndash; different, but alive. She checked on the dahlia anemone first. It lived in the northwest corner of the main pool and had been there longer than Ada &ndash; one of the oldest cards in the Bestiary, painted in Ada's early hand when the brushwork was still cautious. The note at the bottom said: <em>if she goes, something fundamental has changed.</em> The dahlia was still there. But it was closed tight, its tentacles retracted into a dark fist. Wrong, for a still afternoon with the sun on the water. Mara dipped her fingers in. The water was warmer than it should have been.</p>

<p>The rest of the pool was different too. Mara stood at the edge and looked down into water that should have been clear and wasn't. Not murky &ndash; not dirty. It was almost iridescent, the way a soap bubble is: colourless itself but bending the light through it into something else. The other anemones were closed up tight as well. The periwinkles were gone. In their place, along the inner rim of the pool where the rock met the water, there was a growth she'd never seen: fine and branching, like frost on a windowpane, except it was dark red and it moved slightly in the still water, as if breathing.</p>

<p>Mara crouched and looked closer. Not seaweed. Not coral &ndash; there was no coral here, or there never had been. Something else. She reached for Ada's word &ndash; <em>pay attention</em> &ndash; and she paid attention. She looked at the way it anchored, the way it branched, the spacing of the fronds, the colour at the tips versus the base. She tried to find the right comparison. It was like the veins in a leaf, except it grew outward from the rock instead of inward from a stem. It was like the pattern ice makes on a puddle, except it was alive and red and slightly warm to the touch.</p>

<p>She couldn't place it. Not even close. It didn't remind her of anything in the Bestiary, and it didn't remind her of anything she'd heard described, and it didn't remind her of anything at all. It was itself. The category she wanted didn't exist.</p>

<p>That was when the water moved.</p>

<h2>Part Two: The Creature</h2>

<p>Not the tide. Not a wave. The water inside the pool shifted as if something underneath it had turned over, and then the surface stilled, and then it shifted again, and Mara saw it.</p>

<p>She almost didn't. It was the colour of the water &ndash; not camouflaged against it, like a flatfish on sand, but actually the same colour, as if the water had thickened into a shape and then the shape had decided to move. It was about the length of her forearm. It had no edges she could find. Where its body ended and the water began was a question she couldn't answer, even looking straight at it.</p>

<p>It moved along the bottom of the pool with a motion she didn't have a word for. Not swimming. Not crawling. Something between pouring and pulling &ndash; as if it was redistributing itself from one position to the next. It left no trail. It made no sound. When it reached the red growth along the rim, it paused, and the growth leaned toward it the way a plant leans toward light, and the creature's colour shifted from the iridescent green of the pool water to something darker, something closer to the red of the growth, though not exactly red. Closer to the colour she saw when she pressed her palms against her closed eyes.</p>

<p>Mara didn't move. She didn't breathe. She watched.</p>

<p>The creature circled the pool once, slowly. When it passed through a band of sunlight, its body &ndash; if it was a body &ndash; became briefly translucent, and she thought she saw structures inside it: not bones, not organs, but geometries, like the skeleton of a cathedral seen from very far away. Then the light shifted and it was opaque again, and moving, and the structures might have been a trick of refraction.</p>

<p>It stopped at the far side of the pool, where a channel led out to the open sea. It stayed there for a long time. Then it flowed through the channel and was gone.</p>

<p>Mara sat down on the wet rock. Her heart was hammering. She pulled her knees up to her chest and stared at the pool.</p>

<p>She tried to think of what it reminded her of, and nothing came.</p>

<p>She went home and got the Bestiary. She carried it back like an apology.</p>

<hr>

<p>For three days, Mara went to the pool whenever she could get free of the house. The creature came back each time, arriving through the channel with the incoming tide and leaving when the tide turned. She brought the Bestiary the first morning confident it would be in there somewhere &ndash; Ada had drawn everything, and this was just something Mara hadn't learned yet. She went through every card. Twice. Then she went through them a third time, reading the notes, checking the arrows, looking for anything she might have missed.</p>

<p>Nothing. Not even close. The Bestiary had nothing to say.</p>

<p>It was not a fish. It had no fins, no gills, no scales, no eyes she could find. It was not a jellyfish. It had no tentacles, no bell, no trailing filaments. It was not a worm, a slug, a sea cucumber, an urchin, a crustacean, a mollusc. It was not anything with a skeleton or anything without one, because the question of whether it had a skeleton didn't seem to apply to it, the way the question of whether a river has a skeleton doesn't apply to a river.</p>

<p>She closed the Bestiary. Four hundred and thirty-seven cards, and not one of them was even close. And the blank cards Ada had left &ndash; the gaps Mara had wanted filled &ndash; now looked like something else entirely. Not unfinished business. Room.</p>

<p>On the second day, she started drawing it. Ada's rule: draw from life. She brought pencils and the good paper, the watercolour stock Ada had left behind. Her fingers were numb &ndash; she'd been sitting on wet rock for an hour &ndash; but she tried.</p>

<p>The drawings were terrible. On the third page she began to suspect the creature was not cooperating out of principle. She tried Ada's method: the creature from above, then from the side, arrows to the features that mattered. But there was no above or side &ndash; the creature had no orientation she could fix &ndash; and the features didn't hold still long enough to label. She tried outlines. Every time she committed to a line &ndash; <em>the body curves here, the edge is here</em> &ndash; the creature moved and the line was wrong. Not because the creature had changed but because the line implied a boundary that didn't exist. She tried shading without lines, the way Ada drew jellyfish. Wrong: a jellyfish has a shape that holds. She tried everything Ada's Bestiary had taught her, every angle, every technique from 437 cards, and all of it assumed the thing you were drawing had edges.</p>

<p>She sat on the rock with a lap full of failed drawings and thought: <em>Ada would know how to do this.</em> But Ada's method was the thing that wasn't working.</p>

<p>By the third day, she'd stopped trying to draw the creature and started drawing what it <em>did</em>. She used Ada's pencils and Ada's paper, and the drawings looked nothing like Ada's, and she didn't know if that was progress or betrayal. She drew the pool before it arrived: the closed anemones, the red growth, the green water. She drew the pool while it was there: the growth leaning in, the water changing colour around it, the channel it used to come and go. She drew the pool after it left: the growth relaxed, the water clearing, a faint warmth in the rock where it had paused.</p>

<p>These drawings were better. They showed something true. The creature was part of what the pool was becoming. It wasn't a visitor any more than rain is a visitor to a river.</p>

<p>On the third afternoon, the creature did something new. It had been circling the pool in its usual way when it stopped, directly in front of where Mara was sitting, and it rose. Not surfaced &ndash; it didn't break the water the way a whale surfaces. It thickened upward until part of it was above the waterline, and the part that was above the water changed texture, becoming less liquid, more structured, almost solid. It held that shape for perhaps ten seconds, oriented toward her, and she had the overwhelming sense of being <em>regarded</em>. Not with eyes. With attention.</p>

<p>And for a moment the pool looked different. Not physically &ndash; the same water, the same rock, the same growth. But the names weren't holding. Ada's words &ndash; <em>anemone, periwinkle, blenny, whelk</em> &ndash; slid off the things they were supposed to be, and underneath them was something she couldn't quite see, or couldn't quite think, and then the creature sank back and it was gone.</p>

<p>The pool was a pool again with its usual names. Mara looked at her hands. They were shaking, the fingertips blue with cold.</p>

<hr>

<p>She told no one. Not because she'd decided to keep a secret but because she didn't know what she'd say. And because &ndash; she didn't like this thought, but it was true &ndash; the creature rose toward <em>her</em>. As if it were hers. Every sentence she composed in her head came apart before she finished it. <em>I found a creature that</em> &ndash; that what? <em>There's something in the pool at Scar Point that looks like</em> &ndash; like what? Like water that has learned to want something. Like the sound the sea makes at night when you're almost asleep and it could be breathing. Like a word she'd forgotten, except she'd never known it.</p>

<p>Ada would have known what to do. Ada would have sat with her on the rock and said, <em>Describe it without comparing it to anything.</em> And Mara would have tried, and Ada would have listened without interrupting, and between them they would have found the words, or they would have decided that the words didn't exist yet and that was fine, because you could draw what you couldn't say and you could know what you couldn't draw.</p>

<p>But the book she'd left behind didn't have a card for this. And the blank cards &ndash; the ones Mara had wanted filled, that she'd thought meant Ada left the work unfinished &ndash; were starting to look like something Ada had understood and Mara hadn't.</p>

<h2>Part Three: The Village</h2>

<p>The fishers brought it to the village before Mara was ready.</p>

<p>Tam Heddle found three of the creatures in his lobster pots on a Monday morning. They'd flowed in through the slats and the funnel, which shouldn't have been possible &ndash; and they were resting on the bottom of the pots alongside two full-grown crabs, which were alive but huddled in the corners as far from the creatures as they could get.</p>

<p>Tam brought the pots straight to the harbour and set them on the quay, and by the time Mara's father came to look, half the village was there. Mara heard about it at home and ran.</p>

<p>By then, two of the creatures had flowed back through the slats and into the harbour. The third was still in the pot, moving in slow circles, its body shifting colour with each pass &ndash; grey against the pot's metal, green where the harbour water seeped in, something coppery and uncertain where the afternoon light caught it.</p>

<p>Everyone was talking, breath clouding in the cold. Mara stood at the back, her hands in her sleeves, and listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a kind of squid,&rdquo; said Tam, who wanted it to be a kind of squid because then he'd know what to do with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's not a squid, Tam. Where are the arms? Where's the beak?&rdquo; That was Flora Sinclair, who ran the smokehouse and knew more about marine anatomy than anyone else in Cairnhaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it's a squid that's mislaid them,&rdquo; said someone, and nobody laughed because the suggestion was not entirely meant as a joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some kind of colony? Several creatures living as one?&rdquo; offered Mr. Kemp, the parish schoolmaster, who kept books on natural philosophy and still read them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's not colonial. There aren't parts. There's no &ndash; look at it, there's no <em>join</em>.&rdquo; Flora crouched by the pot. &ldquo;It's one thing. I just don't know what thing.&rdquo; She pushed her hair back from her face with her wrist, both hands occupied.</p>

<p>Magnus Bain, who was eighty-three and had fished these waters since he was fourteen, looked at the creature for a long time without speaking. Then he said: &ldquo;That's not from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation shifted. Not from here. If it wasn't from here, where was it from? Within a minute it was carrying pestilence, bad luck, and someone's cousin's death in Skye in '68.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unnatural,&rdquo; said Elspeth Groat, who carried herself as though she'd been born knowing what was right. &ldquo;Things that can't be named can't be right. I'll say it even if the rest of you won't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several people looked at the ground. Mara, who had touched one, said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should send word to Edinburgh,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should put it back in the sea,&rdquo; said one of the younger fishers, who feared it was an omen of bad luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to know how many there are,&rdquo; said Flora.</p>

<p>Magnus said: &ldquo;We need to know what's bringing them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the right question, and nobody had a good answer, so the meeting broke up with the creature still in the pot on the quay. Someone laid an oilskin over it when it rained that evening. As if it might catch cold.</p>

<p>Mara slipped down to the harbour after dark. The creature was still circling, but slower than the ones in the pool, and its colour was flat &ndash; no iridescence, no shifts. When she crouched beside the pot, it thickened upward in the greeting she knew, but faintly, and sank back, and didn't resume.</p>

<p>She knew why. She'd watched the pool creatures in their system &ndash; the growth, the filtered water, the others. This one was alone in a metal pot with harbour water. It was like keeping a fire in a jar: it would use up what it needed and go out.</p>

<p>The clasp was a simple hook. She could open it and the creature could flow back through the slats and find its way to the channel. Five seconds. No one would know.</p>

<p>She could also have knocked on any door on the quay and said: <em>it needs the pool, it'll die in here, I've been watching them.</em> She knew enough to say that. She knew enough to have said it that afternoon, in front of everyone.</p>

<p>She looked at the dark windows. She thought of Elspeth's voice: <em>unnatural</em>. She thought of the faces that had turned toward her and then away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She went home.</p>

<hr>

<p>The meeting happened on Wednesday, in the village hall. The room smelled of peat smoke and wet wool, and there weren't enough candles. Mara sat in the back row next to her father, who was there as a fisher and didn't expect her to have opinions. She had opinions.</p>

<p>Sandy Flett chaired, because he was elder of the council, and he started by saying that several more of the creatures had been found: two in the harbour itself, one in the freshwater outlet where the burn met the sea, and at least a dozen in the tidal pools along Scar Point. He also said, with the careful voice of a man choosing not to name names, that someone had tried salting one, the way you'd salt a catch. It had come apart into the brine as if it had never been solid. Nothing left to eat, and the salt was spoiled. Someone muttered, &ldquo;So that's the catch and the salt, then,&rdquo; and Sandy pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've checked the Bestiary,&rdquo; Sandy said, and Mara went rigid, because the Bestiary was still on her shelf and nobody had asked to borrow it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ada's Bestiary,&rdquo; he clarified. &ldquo;The one in the village hall. The old copy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old copy. Mara hadn't known there was an old copy. She felt something &ndash; relief? jealousy? &ndash; and set it aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing matches. Not even close. So we're in new territory. The question is what we do about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room sorted itself, as rooms do, into factions.</p>

<p>The fishers wanted the creatures gone. Not out of malice but out of economics: the things were in their pots, in their nets, in their fishing grounds, and every pot with a creature in it was a pot without a sellable catch. Tam spoke for this group, and he was reasonable. &ldquo;I'm not saying kill them. I'm saying they're not meant to be here, and we need to move them on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flora spoke next, and she'd been busy. She'd dissected the one that had been left in the pot &ndash; it had gone still overnight, and Mara's heart with it &ndash; and what she'd found had shaken her. &ldquo;I've never seen anything like it,&rdquo; Flora said. &ldquo;The internal structure isn't &ndash; it doesn't have organs in any sense I recognise. But it's not simple. It's complex in a way I don't have words for. I'd need proper instruments to say more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp made the case for Edinburgh: send specimens, get learned opinion, have it properly classified. &ldquo;We can't make decisions about something we can't even name,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>And Magnus, who'd been quiet, said the thing that changed the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's not just the creatures. The water's different. The weed is different. The water at twenty fathoms is warmer than it should be this time of year. I've been fishing this coast for nearly seventy years, and the coast I fished last month is not the coast I'm fishing now.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;And it's not just strange &ndash; it's dying. The pools below the headland are dead. Grey water, nothing living. I haven't hauled a catch worth the name in three weeks, and nor has any man here. The creatures aren't the problem. They're the symptom. Something is happening to the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room went quiet. Everyone had noticed pieces of it &ndash; the wrong tides, the empty nets, the green water, the strange growths on the rocks, the dead pools they'd been pretending not to see. But no one had said it out loud as a single thing before. Magnus had, and now it was in the room, and it was frightening.</p>

<p>Sandy asked what they should do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clear the creatures from the harbour and the fishing grounds,&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;That's immediate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't destroy them until we know what they are,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;That's sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write to Edinburgh,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp. &ldquo;That's long-term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find out why the water's changing,&rdquo; said Magnus. &ldquo;That's the real job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then Elspeth said: &ldquo;I hear young Mara's been at those pools every day. Sitting by the water. Talking, some say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mara's father put his hand on her knee. Not to comfort. To hold her still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children are curious,&rdquo; Magnus said. &ldquo;Leave it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curiosity and foolishness look alike from a distance,&rdquo; Elspeth said. &ldquo;Those creatures aren't natural, and a child who seeks them out &ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said leave it.&rdquo; Magnus's voice was flat and final.</p>

<p>The room moved on. But Mara had seen the faces that turned toward her and then looked away, and she understood something new: that the creatures weren't the only thing in Cairnhaven that people didn't know what to make of.</p>

<p>No one asked Mara anything, because she was eleven.</p>

<h2>Part Four: The Understanding</h2>

<p>She went to the pools the next morning before the house was awake. The sky was still dark, the stars just beginning to fade, and her breath hung white in the air.</p>

<p>She checked the northwest corner first. The dahlia anemone was gone. In its place, the red growth covered the rock in a pattern so fine it looked embroidered. It was beautiful. But it was not the dahlia, and Ada's card said <em>if she goes, something fundamental has changed,</em> and now the change had come.</p>

<p>The rest of the pool was different again. The red growth had spread further &ndash; it now covered most of the inner rim, and its fronds were longer, more elaborate, branching into patterns that looked almost architectural. The other anemones were gone entirely. In their place, clustered near the growth, were small round organisms she hadn't seen before: translucent, fixed to the rock, pulsing faintly, connected to each other by threads so fine they were visible only when the light caught them at the right angle.</p>

<p>The creature was there. And it was not alone.</p>

<p>Three of them moved through the pool. They were different sizes &ndash; one about as long as her forearm, the familiar one; one smaller, about the length of her hand; and one larger, nearly the span of her arms outstretched. They moved together but not in synchrony. The large one stayed near the channel. The small one circled the growth. The familiar one &ndash; she was sure it was the same one, though she couldn't have said how she knew &ndash; moved to its usual spot in front of her and thickened upward in what she'd come to think of as its greeting.</p>

<p>She sat very still and watched them.</p>

<p>The small one did something she hadn't seen before. It settled against the red growth and became still, and where it rested, the growth changed: the fronds nearest to it lengthened and thickened and turned a deeper colour, almost purple. When the small creature moved on, the growth kept its new shape. The creature had fed it. Or tuned it. Or agreed with it. Or some verb that didn't exist yet.</p>

<p>It was tending the growth &ndash; the same growth that covered the northwest corner where the dahlia used to be. Mara watched the fronds deepen toward purple and felt two things at once that didn't go together: wonder at what she was seeing, and grief for what it had replaced.</p>

<p>The large one was doing something at the channel. It had positioned itself across the opening, and the water flowing through the channel was moving differently &ndash; slower, or filtered, or altered in some way Mara couldn't identify. When she looked more closely, she saw that the water downstream of the large creature was a different colour from the water upstream. Not greener. Clearer. As if the creature was processing the water passing through it, or through the space it occupied, because the boundary between the creature and the water was still the question she couldn't answer.</p>

<p>Mara opened Ada's Bestiary. She didn't open it to a card. She opened it to one of the gaps &ndash; a blank card between the periwinkles and the limpets &ndash; and she looked at the empty space, and she thought about what Ada had said. <em>A bestiary is never finished. If it's finished, it's wrong.</em></p>

<p>She closed the book and looked at the pool.</p>

<p>Where were the anemones? Closed up and gone. The periwinkles? Vanished. The blennies &ndash; she hadn't seen a blenny in weeks. She could picture Ada's cards for each of them: the anemone with its labelled tentacles, the periwinkle shown from above and below, the blenny with <em>shy, hides under ledges</em> in Ada's handwriting. Those cards were still true. But the creatures on them weren't in the pool any more.</p>

<p>What was in the pool was the growth, and the small fixed organisms, and the three creatures &ndash; the small one tending, the large one filtering, the familiar one circling. She watched the small one settle against the growth and the fronds lean in, and she watched the large one shift in the channel and the water clear behind it. They weren't just here at the same time. Everything she watched did something that mattered to something else.</p>

<p>She was about to stand when all three creatures stopped.</p>

<p>Not at once &ndash; in sequence, like instruments falling silent. The small one lifted from the growth. The large one shifted in the channel. The familiar one turned. And then all three were oriented toward her, and the <em>regarded</em> feeling came back, but it wasn't one creature's attention now. It was three, or one attention shared among three, and it didn't stop.</p>

<p>The names fell away again, further than before. Not just the pool's names &ndash; her own. She wasn't the girl watching. She wasn't watching at all. She was inside the system and the system was looking back, and there was no edge between her and the water, and her chest was tight and her hands were shaking and she couldn't find herself in it, the way you can't find your own face without a mirror.</p>

<p>She stood up. She backed away from the rock.</p>

<p>The creatures resumed their circling, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Mara walked home. Not running &ndash; too shaken for that, walking carefully, the way you walk when you've slipped on ice and the ground no longer feels trustworthy. But the seeing didn't stop at the pool's edge.</p>

<p>Smoke was rising from chimneys as the village woke, peat and fish broth and not much of either, and she saw it as breathing &ndash; each house drawing air and giving it back changed. The boats at the harbour were arranged by function without anyone deciding it: the trawlers together, the line boats together, the small boats wedged between them like punctuation. Her father was in the kitchen when she came in, and she watched his hands move from kettle to cup to table in a pattern so practised it was invisible to him, and she thought of the creatures circling, and her throat closed.</p>

<p>She put the Bestiary on its shelf and sat on her bed and pressed her hands against her face until the world felt solid.</p>

<p>She didn't go back the next day. Or the day after. She helped in the house. She mended a net with her father and tried to talk about ordinary things, but the words felt thinner than before &ndash; pencil, not ink. Names she'd used without thinking all her life &ndash; <em>kettle, harbour, path</em> &ndash; sat on top of things instead of being them. She'd look at a stone wall and see the stones doing something to each other, holding and pushing at once, and then she'd blink and it was just a wall again, except it wasn't, not quite.</p>

<p>On the third morning she went back to the pools. Not because the fear had passed &ndash; it sat in her stomach like a stone. She went because the seeing wouldn't stop, and sitting in the house pretending it had was worse than going where it made sense.</p>

<p>The creatures were there. They greeted her in the usual way &ndash; the familiar one thickening upward, the others circling &ndash; and the greeting was gentle, and the overwhelm did not come back. The village was behind her. The seeing that wouldn't stop was just seeing, here. After a while her hands steadied and she took out her pencils.</p>

<p>She drew for an hour. Then she got up and walked along the shore.</p>

<p>The fog came in fast &ndash; warm water, cold air, the coast gone in minutes. The headland vanished. The path vanished. The sea was a sound without a direction, and it was on the wrong side.</p>

<p>Her heart hammered. She could hear the water below her now, not just beside her &ndash; the rocks here dropped to the channel and she couldn't see the edge.</p>

<p>She kept going because standing still was worse. Pool by pool, on her hands and knees where the rock was uneven. The old pools were cold and clean-smelling, periwinkles rough under her fingers. The dead pools were warm and still and smelled of sulphur, the rock bare and slick &ndash; she slipped on the rim of one and caught herself hard. The transitional ones were warm but alive &ndash; she could feel the growth, fine and branching, and the water moved faintly even without wind. The new pools were warmest, and busy with things she couldn't see but could feel brushing past her hand when she reached in.</p>

<p>At one point she stopped and didn't know which way she'd come. Her breathing was ragged and too loud. She crouched and put her hand in the nearest pool &ndash; warm, growth against her fingers, something circling below. New pool. The sea was close. She turned inland and crawled until the rock under her felt like the path.</p>

<p>The fog thinned after an hour. The coast came back, pool by pool, looking exactly as it had felt: a progression along the shore from old to dead to new.</p>

<p>At first she thought the creatures had done this. Poisoned the pools. Killed everything. For a few terrible minutes she stood at the edge of a dead pool and believed it, and everything she'd been watching turned sinister &ndash; not tending but destroying, not filtering but poisoning. Elspeth's word came to her: <em>unnatural</em>. She almost went home.</p>

<p>But the dead pools had no creatures in them. She looked again, pool by pool, making herself be careful. The creatures were in the transitional pools and the new ones, never the dead. The death came first. The creatures came after. They weren't killing the old coast. They were inhabiting what came next.</p>

<p>Some pools were in between &ndash; old residents thinning out, new growth appearing, one or two of the creatures circling uncertainly. And a few, the ones closest to the open sea, had fully turned over: busy with organisms she'd never seen, doing things she couldn't name.</p>

<p>The dead phase was in the middle. Not every pool had made it through.</p>

<p>She ran to the harbour.</p>

<hr>

<p>Magnus was mending nets. He was always mending nets, his fingers moving without looking, the way a knitter's do. He looked up when Mara arrived, out of breath, and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's not just the creatures,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The whole shore is changing. The tidal pools &ndash; some of them are completely different. New growth, new animals, everything connected. It's a whole new system coming in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Magnus put down his needle. &ldquo;Sit,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of new system?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to describe what she'd seen. The red growth. The small fixed organisms. The creatures tending and filtering and circling. The progression along the shore &ndash; old pools, dead pools, transitional pools, new pools. The dead ones in between, where nothing lived at all. She stumbled over the words, because the words kept reaching for comparisons that didn't work, but Magnus listened the way Ada used to listen: without interrupting, without finishing her sentences, without trying to translate what she was saying into something he already understood.</p>

<p>When she was done, he was quiet for a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother saw something like this once,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not here. She went up to Shetland one summer, before you were born, and the water up there had changed, and the fish were different, and the birds were struggling because the sand eels had moved. She came back and said the bestiary for those waters was out of date. Not wrong. Out of date. She said the sea had moved and the book hadn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She started drawing again. She said you don't argue with the sea about what lives in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mara felt her eyes sting. She pressed her hands against her knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The council wants to clear them from the harbour,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can't clear a whole system. You can't &ndash; it's not like sweeping the floor. Everything's connected. If you take the creatures out, the growth has nothing tending it, and the filtered water goes wrong, and &ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Magnus said. &ldquo;But Tam can't feed his family, and Flora's found something she doesn't understand and that frightens her even though she won't say so, and Sandy has to keep everyone from doing something desperate, and none of them have seen what you've seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have to show them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Magnus picked up his needle again. &ldquo;That's generally how it works,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bring good boots,&rdquo; he added, as if the main hazard were slipping.</p>

<h2>Part Five: The New Bestiary</h2>

<p>She didn't call another meeting. Meetings were for adults who'd already decided what they thought and wanted to argue about it in a warm room. Instead, she went to people one at a time.</p>

<p>She took Flora to the pools first, because Flora knew the sea better than anyone in Cairnhaven bar Magnus, and because Flora had cut open the creature from the pot &ndash; the one Mara had let die &ndash; and Mara owed her a living one. They went at dawn, before the harbour woke up, and Mara showed her the old pools and the dead pools and the new pools and the ones in between, and Flora crouched by the water for an hour without speaking, watching the creatures move through their world.</p>

<p>When the familiar creature rose in its greeting, Flora pushed herself backward on the rock with both hands, fast, the way you pull back from a hot pan. She stood and brushed off her skirts and didn't look at Mara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It knows you,&rdquo; she said. Her voice was level and careful.</p>

<p>Flora stood and looked along the shore at the other pools. She didn't say anything for a long time. When she turned back her hands were in her pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you known about this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two weeks. I didn't know how to explain it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've just explained it perfectly.&rdquo; Flora took her hands out of her pockets. They were still shaking. She looked at them as if they belonged to someone else, then put them back.</p>

<p>She asked Elspeth Groat. Elspeth opened the door and looked at her, and for a moment her face did something Mara didn't have a name for &ndash; not anger, not fear, something older and more tired than either. Then it was gone. &ldquo;I'll not be led to those pools by a child,&rdquo; she said, and closed her door.</p>

<p>She took Tam next, which was harder, because Tam hadn't sold a catch worth the name in a month and his family was eating salt stores. But Tam was also a man who'd lived on the sea his whole life, and when Mara showed him the new pool &ndash; the fully converted one near the point, alive and busy with its unfamiliar residents &ndash; he stood looking at it, rubbing the back of his neck, the way a farmer stands looking at a field that's been planted with something he didn't choose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's a working system,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That's not a mess. That's a going concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what am I supposed to fish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the question Mara couldn't answer, and she didn't pretend to. &ldquo;I don't know yet. But if the water keeps changing, the old fish might not come back. And if they don't, then whatever's in there &ndash;&rdquo; she gestured at the pool &ndash; &ldquo;is what we've got. Clearing it out doesn't bring the mackerel back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam was quiet for a while. &ldquo;Your gran would have made a card for them by now,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm working on it.&rdquo;</p>

<hr>

<p>She was.</p>

<p>Mara had started a new section in the Bestiary. Not replacing Ada's cards &ndash; those described a coast that had been real and might still be real in the deep water where the old cold currents held. But behind the last card, in the blank cards Ada had left, Mara began painting new ones.</p>

<p>It was hard. She couldn't draw the creatures the way Ada had drawn haddock and jellyfish, with a clear outline and labelled parts, because the creatures didn't have clear outlines or separable parts. So she drew them the way she'd learned to during those first difficult days at the pool: she drew what they did. One card showed the small creature against the growth, with arrows indicating how the fronds responded. Another showed the large creature in the channel, with the water changing colour as it passed through. A third showed the familiar creature's greeting: the thickening upward, the pause, the sense of being regarded.</p>

<p>For labels, she used Ada's format: the name at the top, the features along the side, the notes at the bottom. But the names were provisional. She wrote them in pencil, not ink, because she wasn't sure of them yet. The features weren't anatomical &ndash; they were behavioural. And the notes were full of questions. <em>Why does the growth respond? How does it filter the water? Is the greeting for me, or would it greet anything that sat still long enough?</em></p>

<p>She made a card for the red growth, too, and for the small fixed organisms, and for a ribbon-like thing she'd found in the new pools that seemed to connect the growth to the rock in a way that wasn't quite roots and wasn't quite glue and wasn't quite anything she had a word for.</p>

<p>When she had seven cards, she brought them to Flora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are good,&rdquo; Flora said, turning them over. &ldquo;These are really good. But you've got no names.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know what to call them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother named things by what they did, mostly. Practical names. The haddock card doesn't say <em>Gadus</em> anything. It says <em>haddock, good eating, best September</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mara looked at her cards. The familiar creature, the one that greeted her. She'd written <em>the watcher</em> in pencil at the top of its card, and for three days she'd seen a watcher &ndash; something still and observational, oriented toward her. She'd missed the circling, the colour shifts, the way it paused at the growth. The name had narrowed what she noticed. She crossed it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know enough to name them by what they do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I've only been watching for two weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then keep watching,&rdquo; Flora said. &ldquo;The names will come. They'll be wrong at first, and then they'll be less wrong, and eventually they'll be right enough to be useful. That's how it works.&rdquo;</p>

<hr>

<p>Mr. Kemp had written to Edinburgh. No answer had come. Edinburgh, she thought, moved at the speed of paper.</p>

<p>Mara's father came home from the harbour one evening and sat down without taking off his coat. &ldquo;Some folk are talking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;About you and the pools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not everyone. But enough.&rdquo; He looked at the table. &ldquo;They say the creatures come when you're there. That they act different around you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They come with the tide,&rdquo; Mara said. &ldquo;They'd come whether I was there or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that. But knowing it and having folk believe it are different things in a small place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him. &ldquo;Ada spent forty years at those pools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;And folk talked about her too. Elspeth walked those pools with her once, when they were girls.&rdquo; He looked at the table. &ldquo;Ada chose the pools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the first time Mara understood that Ada's Bestiary &ndash; the careful, practical, indispensable book that the whole village relied on &ndash; had been made by someone the village hadn't entirely trusted. That the knowledge and the strangeness were the same thing, and always had been. And that choosing the pools meant not choosing other things &ndash; things Mara's father wouldn't say and didn't need to.</p>

<hr>

<p>A month later, the water was still changing.</p>

<p>The green cast had spread further along the coast. The old fish were thinning out; not gone, but fewer, and farther from shore. The new organisms were spreading: the growth, the creatures, and others Mara hadn't seen before &ndash; something like a starfish that wasn't a starfish, something like a kelp that wasn't a kelp, something that burrowed into sand and left spiral patterns behind it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In February, the creature did something that made Mara rewrite its card entirely.</p>

<p>She'd been visiting the pool through the winter, even in sleet, even in the dark mornings before anyone else was stirring. The creature came reliably with the tide, and over the months she'd mapped its behaviour in detail: where it paused, how long it circled, how it oriented itself toward the channel when the tide was about to turn. She felt she was beginning to understand its role in the life of the pool, though she would have admitted, if asked, that she might be projecting patterns onto randomness.</p>

<p>But on a Thursday morning in February, the creature stopped circling, moved to the centre of the pool, and split.</p>

<p>Not violently. Not like breaking. Like a drop of water on a window that elongates and becomes two drops. One moment there was one creature; then there was a thickening, a lengthening, a moment when it went translucent and she saw the geometries again &ndash; the cathedral structures from months ago, dividing, replicating on each side of a narrowing join &ndash; and then there were two, each about two-thirds the size of the original, each moving independently, each a different colour: one the familiar iridescent green, the other something new, a deep amber that caught the winter light like whisky in a glass.</p>

<p>Mara stared. Her pencil had stopped on the paper. She'd been drawing the circling pattern. Now there were two patterns, diverging, and her drawing was wrong, and she didn't care because she was watching something no one in Cairnhaven had ever seen and maybe no one in the world had ever seen, and it was happening in a pool she could walk to from her house.</p>

<p>The two creatures circled each other once, slowly. Then the green one went to the growth and the amber one went to the channel, and they began their work as if they'd always been two, as if the world had always contained them both.</p>

<p>Mara tore out the old card &ndash; <em>the watcher</em> still crossed out at the top, no name beneath it. She started two new ones. In pencil, at the top of the green one, she wrote: <em>the gardener</em>. At the top of the amber one: <em>the gatekeeper</em>.</p>

<p>The names were wrong. She knew they were wrong. But they were wrong in the right direction &ndash; they described what the creatures did in relation to the pool, not what they were in isolation. They were useful names, for now. She'd change them when she understood better.</p>

<p>The creature the card had been for &ndash; the one that had greeted her, that had regarded her &ndash; was gone. She had never found its name.</p>

<p>A tear hit the paper and she had to blot it before it smudged the paint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you could see this,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the kitchen that evening, she showed her father the new cards.</p>

<p>He looked at them for a long time. He wasn't a man who said much, and he said less since Ada had died, but he held each card by its edges, tilting it toward the firelight, and when he was done he said: &ldquo;You've got her eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got her book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's not the same thing.&rdquo; He put the cards down. &ldquo;The Bestiary in the village hall &ndash; the old copy &ndash; it stops a generation back. Your grandmother kept going. She said the book in the hall was a picture of a moment, and the one she kept at home was the living thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The living one doesn't have these in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it needs to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the press above the hearth, the one Mara wasn't tall enough to reach, and brought down a packet of watercolour cards. Good ones &ndash; thick, cotton-rag paper with a faint tooth. The same kind Ada had used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sent for these in September,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Before she got ill. I found them after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mara took the packet. It was heavier than she expected. She ran her thumb across the edge of the cards and felt the texture Ada had chosen, the surface that held watercolour without buckling, that let you build up layers of transparent colour until you had something that looked like it was lit from inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knew,&rdquo; Mara said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there'd be more to draw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her father didn't answer. He didn't need to. Ada had left the gaps in the Bestiary and the cards in the press, and whether she'd known what was coming or simply known that <em>something</em> always comes, the result was the same: room for what came next.</p>

<p>Mara took the cards upstairs and sat at her desk. She lit the candle, wet her brush, and began to paint. The watercolours smelled of gum arabic, a sweet clean smell she'd always associated with Ada. Outside, the sea moved against the harbour wall with a sound she didn't quite recognise &ndash; a different pitch, a different rhythm, as if even the water's voice was changing. Somewhere in Cairnhaven, Elspeth Groat was telling someone that Mara was a strange child. She was right. She was also wrong, but Mara didn't yet have words for the difference.</p>

<p>The Bestiary had 437 cards that described a coast that was passing and seven new ones, in pencil, that described a coast that had no name yet. The dahlia anemone was gone. Edinburgh had not written back. The harbour was empty and the salt stores were running low.</p>

<p>She wrote a name at the top of a new card in pencil, looked at it, rubbed it half away with her thumb.</p>

<p>She painted.</p>
